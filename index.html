    Earth, aka the "Blue Marble," is the third rock from the Sun and the universe's prime real estate for life—at least as far as we know. It's got everything: oxygen to breathe, water to drink, gravity to keep you grounded (literally), and just the right amount of atmosphere to avoid being fried or frozen. This spinning, spherical VIP hosts over 8 million species (including you), all powered by a 4.5-billion-year-old molten core that still hasn’t taken a day off. Fun fact: Earth travels at 67,000 mph around the Sun, so even when you're lying on the couch, you're technically moving faster than a race car.
