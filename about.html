      <h1>Moon</h1>
      <p>
        The Moon, Earth's only natural satellite, is a beacon in the night sky and a silent witness to the history of our planet. Formed over 4.5 billion years ago, its surface is marked by craters, ancient lava plains, and mountains. The Moon’s gravitational pull drives Earth’s ocean tides, creating a dynamic relationship between the two celestial bodies. Despite its barren landscape and lack of atmosphere, the Moon has inspired countless myths, scientific exploration, and human curiosity. Its phases, from the radiant full moon to the mysterious crescent, continue to captivate observers around the globe.
